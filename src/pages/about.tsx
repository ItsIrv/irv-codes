            My programming journey began in middle school, inspired by my love
            for online games. I became fascinated with how these games worked,
            which led me to explore their web counterparts, like registration
            forms, online shops, and account systems. This curiosity drove me to
            learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP all at once, relying on Google,
            documentation, and endless questions to hone my skills.

            Outside of work, I enjoy gaming and traveling. My go-to games
            include MMORPGs and FPS titles like League of Legends, Overwatch,
            Call of Duty, Fortnite, and Marvel Rivals. Traveling allows me to
            recharge and explore new perspectives, balancing my professional
            life with adventure and fun.
