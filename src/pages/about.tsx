                  My programming journey began in middle school, inspired by my
                  love for online games. I became fascinated with how these
                  games worked, which led me to explore their web counterparts,
                  like registration forms, online shops, and account systems.
                  This curiosity drove me to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
                  PHP all at once, relying on Google, documentation, and endless
                  questions to hone my skills.

                <p className='text-lg max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-4'>
                  Over time, I transitioned from experimenting with game
                  modifications to creating web and mobile applications. I enjoy
                  the full-stack process of building robust backends and
                  designing user-friendly interfaces. Recently, working with AI
                  and cutting-edge technologies has added a new layer of
                  excitement to my projects.
                </p>
                <p className='text-lg max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-4'>
                  I thrive on projects that let me take initiative, own my work,
                  and make meaningful impacts. Whether it‚Äôs developing powerful
                  systems or crafting seamless user experiences, I‚Äôm always
                  ready to tackle the next challenge.

                  Outside of work, I enjoy gaming and traveling. My go-to games
