After years of building applications for others, it was time to create something just for me—a portfolio that reflects my expertise, passions, and the journey I've undertaken as a developer.

## Why Build This Portfolio?

As developers, we often focus so much on client work or internal projects that we rarely get the chance to build something personal. This portfolio was my opportunity to showcase my skills, work experience, and personality, all in one place. It serves multiple purposes:

- **Professional Presence**: A centralized location to present my work and skills.
- **Transparency**: An open window into my career, tools, and methodologies.
- **Inspiration**: A way to connect with peers, inspire collaboration, and share ideas.

# Purpose

This portfolio isn't just a showcase—it's a statement. It highlights my ability to create engaging, accessible, and performance-focused applications. It also provides a platform to share my thoughts and insights through blog posts, like this one, which further demonstrates my passion for development and continuous learning.

Whether you're a potential client, collaborator, or just passing through, I hope this site gives you a clear understanding of who I am as a developer.

## Tools and Technologies Used

Building this portfolio allowed me to explore and utilize modern tools and frameworks that I'm passionate about:

- **[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)**: Chosen for its clean structure and robust blog features, making it an ideal choice for a developer-focused site.
- **React**: Used as my frontend framework; Docusaurus is built on top of it.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling the site with simplicity and consistency while maintaining a modern aesthetic.
- **Markdown**: Leveraged for creating content in an easy-to-manage and developer-friendly format.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated deployments ensure every update is reflected immediately, maintaining efficiency in development.

## What's Next?

This portfolio is just the beginning. Over time, I plan to:

- Share more insights and technical write-ups in the blog section.
- Continuously iterate on the design and functionality to keep it up-to-date.
- Highlight ongoing and upcoming projects to showcase my evolving skillset.
