# Why I Built useWebSocket & WebSocketService

WebSockets are a cornerstone for real-time interactivity in modern web applications. However, managing WebSocket connections, subscriptions, and events can quickly become overwhelming. While working with **Laravel Echo**, I encountered challenges that led me to create two utilities:

<!-- truncate -->

1. **WebSocketService**: A singleton service for managing WebSocket connections.
2. **useWebSocket**: A Vue composable that wraps WebSocketService for seamless integration at the component level.

---

## Motivation

While using Laravel Echo for WebSocket connections, I realized I needed a more
structured and reusable way to:

- Manage multiple WebSocket connections.
- Handle subscriptions to private and public channels.
- Automatically clean upresources to prevent memory leaks.
- Avoid duplicated code across components.

Thus, **WebSocketService** and **useWebSocket** were born out of necessity.

## Current Features

- Managing active WebSocket connections.
- Subscribing to private and public channels.
- Listening to specific events.
- Automatic reconnection handling.
- Cleaning up active subscriptions and connections.

---

## Roadmap

- **Enhanced Event Management**: Add methods to
  view and manage active events, subscriptions, and channels.
- **Framework
  Agnostic Design**: Decouple the utilities from Vue and Laravel Echo for
  broader compatibility.
- **WebSocket Adapters**: Introduce inheritance
  patterns for custom WebSocket implementations.
